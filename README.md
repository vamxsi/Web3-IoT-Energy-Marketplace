# Web3-IoT-Energy-Marketplace
This project simulates a micro-energy grid where an IoT device can act as either an energy Producer (e.g., a home with solar panels generating excess power) or a Consumer. Using a simulated Web3 ledger, Producers can "sell" their excess energy to Consumers in exchange for a fictional cryptocurrency ("EnergyCoin")
